First of all I will explain log in menu features.  

 The first part of log in menu is “Balance inquiry”. Basically balance inquiry view 
current account balance. This option displays the user's current account balance, 
allowing them to stay informed about their finances. 

 The next part is “Deposit”. It work to add funds to the account. Basically Users can 
add funds to their account by entering the desired amount. The system validates the 
input and updates the balance accordingly 

 Then the next part is “withdrew”. The purpose of withdraw to Remove funds from the 
account, subject to sufficient balance. This feature enables users to withdraw funds. 
The system checks for sufficient balance before processing the transaction to prevent 
overdrafts. 

 The next part is “Change Pin”. Its use when Update the account's PIN after verifying 
the current one or enhanced security, users can update their PIN. The system first 
verifies the existing PIN before allowing a change. 

 The next part is “mini statement” it Display a list of recent transactions. And Users 
can view a summary of their recent transactions, providing transparency and easy 
tracking of account activity. 

 The last past of log in menu is “Log out” it works Exit the session and return to the 
main menu. This option securely ends the user's session, ensuring that their account 
remains protected." 

Now I will explain admin view option and exit and its purpose. Beyond user functionalities, the 
system includes an Admin View. This feature allows administrators to monitor all registered 
users and their respective balances. It's a crucial tool for overseeing the system's overall 
operation and ensuring data integrity 

The Exit option allows users to terminate the ATM session safely and return to the main menu or 
close the application. 

The last part of presentation is conclusion  
In conclusion, this C++ ATM simulation project effectively demonstrates the application of 
object-oriented programming principles to model real-world banking operations. From secure 
user authentication to comprehensive account management and administrative oversight, the 
system encapsulates essential features of an actual ATM. 

This project not only reinforces fundamental programming concepts but also provides practical 
insights into system design and user interaction. Thank you for your attention
